<body> the gen 9 meta of sinlges smogon format is a new meta and it is different from all others due to the addition of <i> terrastilization </i> this allows you to change your pokemons type once per battle while retaining your pokemons original STAB (same type attack bonus) here are some significant meta threats 
  <ul> great tusk baxcalibur iron valient dragapult galarian slowbro husiuian samurott enamourus kinggambit</ul>
  these are the leading offensive and defensive cores for many teams you will see on the ladder <br>
  <img src= "https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/scarlet-violet/normal/kingambit.png"><br> 
this is kingambit he was suspect tested for gen 9 OU but passed and was banned to ubers in national dex <br>
now before we go any further you may be asking what is ubers and ou? this is the ranking system of pokemon and what formats they can be used in to make it fair if a pokemon like zacian was in OU he would be on every team conversly pokemon like raichu would never get usage if lower tiers didnt exist like PU <br>
<ul> <li> AG- stands for anything goes the tier for all pokemon but is mostly dominated by overpowered ones this was so rowdy that it is no longer an official ladder format </li>
<li> ubers- this is for extremely powerful pokemon that arent game breaking but are still very strong mostly comprised of legendaries </li> 
<li> OU- OU is overused pokemon this is one of the more popular formats with weaker legendaries and strong normal pokemon pokemon in lower tiers can at times be viable in this tier </li>
<li> UU- UU is underused pokemon these pokemon are to weak for OU but still decent pokemon pokemon with good stats but bad moves or pokemon with good moves and bad stats or just overall average pokemon tend to fall in this tier </li> 
<li> RU- rarley used pokemon tend to be pokemon with bad typings or bad stats or just with multiple flaws but they still arent the worse and have their own niche with a few good qualities </li>
<li> NU- never used pokemon unlike the name are actually used just not very much these pokemon have major flaws and cant deal with stronger pokemon at all but there is still one or two things about them that make them useful like being a middle evolution of a OU pokemon </li>
<li> PU- this tier is pretty much the bottom of the barrel pokemon in this tier are really bad and can only face off agianst other really bad pokemon PU stands for penguin umbrella, perfectly useless and painfully uninspiring because its a fun and unserious tier </li> </ul> <br>
there are pokemon beneath PU such as NFE (not fully evolved) or just bad pokemon like beartic or ampharos <br>
